# Documind
DocuMind is an end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to bridge the gap between static PDF documents and actionable intelligence. Instead of manually searching through hundreds of pages, DocuMind allows users to engage in natural language conversations with their data to extract precise, context-aware insights.
